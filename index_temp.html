// 2. You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

//3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of

	var options = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"];
	var wins = 0;
	var losses = 0;
	var tries = 9;
	var userInput = [];
	
//User press keybaord letter
//Tries 9 times if user don't win

		var userguess = String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode).toLowerCase();
		   console.log("userguess: " +userguess);

		//save user guess in to array
		
        
		



		//computer generated random letter    

		var computerGuess = options[Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length)];

//
//if user wins add to wins
//
//
//
//start the game over
//
//
//
//user tries multiple times upto 9 times
//
//
//
//if user unable to guess - increase loss
//
//
//restart the game without refresh
//
//
//
//print score and user entered letter on browser
//


// 4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

// 5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

// 6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

// 7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

// 8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

// 9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).	 -->
